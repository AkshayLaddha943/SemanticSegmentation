# SemanticSegmentation

# PersonDetection-RCNN-YOLO_COCODataset

This repository contains semantic segmentation implementation on an Image Dataset generated from CARLA

## Pre-requisites

The project was performed with the following tools

- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)

- [Pytorch 2.0](https://pytorch.org/)

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  

## Dataset

Download the dataset from here - (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumaresanmanickavelu/lyft-udacity-challenge)

## Results

The code is pretty self-explanatory, To train the model and visualize the results, simply run the train.py file. For this project, I have used the U-Net architecture, you can replace the architecture of your choice or create a custom encoder-decoder architecture by making changes in the model.py file
